This is a simple log.txt because I didn't find out until later that I needed a log.txt for this part as well.

Simply put, I spent pretty much 6-8 hours every day this week reading, watching videos, trying to come with terms what exxactly the assignment was requiring and how to make progress with it.  The material was very very VERY difficult to read through and understand and I...HAVE both BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering, so it was very disencouraging to have such a difficult time figuring out how everything works together, the material provided was not sufficient and once I went on the discussion board, I was able to get some sort of ideas, how things worked, and slowly put small parts on my program, trying to break down parts as required from the instructions.

I spent most of the weekend (Jan 30 - Feb 1st) working on this trying to get parts implemented and working, commenting out parts, and trying to get some sort of results, but I was never able to successfully get anything to work, even though I didn't receive any errors in my console.  I talked with so many people on Google Hangout, asking questions about how parts worked, even checked other people source files, to get an glimpse of how things should look like, but couldn't get mine to work.

This has to be the worse assignment I've ever worked on in my entire scholar experience and I've dealt with EXTREMELY hard Mechanical Engineering projects, but there was always some sort of good guidance and good background behind them, in this case, there is NO background, and its like tossing us in a battlefield with a fork and blindfolds, expecting us to win the battle singlehanded.
